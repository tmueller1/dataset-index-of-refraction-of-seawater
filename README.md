# Index of Refraction of Seawater

This dataset contains 154 measurements of the index of refraction of seawater for different temperatures, wavelengths, and salinities. It is taken from [[1]](#1). [[1]](#1) also cites some empirical equations that describe the dependency of the refractive index on the other measures.The regression equation according to McNeil ([[2]](#2)) was used as a reference:
η(S,T,λ)=1,3247-2,5*10^(-6) T^2+S(2*10^(-4)-8*10^(-7) T)+3300/λ^2 -(3,2*10^7)/λ^4 
with t as temperature, S as salinity and \lamba as wavelength.
